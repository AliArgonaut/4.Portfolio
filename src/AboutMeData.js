I believe that great developers are defined by their ability to create functional, engaging experiences that users genuinely enjoy. In addition to coding, I love standup comedy and think we should all let ourselves laugh at the little, corny moments in lifeâ€”because, sometimes, those are the best. One day, I'd love to be on Kill Tony and see if I'm actually funny for real.",
