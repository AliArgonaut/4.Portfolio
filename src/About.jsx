            <p className="text">I'm a software engineering student at St. Leo University with a passion for full-stack development and a growing interest in embedded systems. I believe that great developers are defined by their ability to create functional, engaging experiences that users genuinely enjoy. In addition to coding, I love standup comedy and think we should all let ourselves laugh at the little, corny moments in lifeâ€”because, sometimes, those are the best. One day, I would love to be on Kill Tony and see if I am actually funny.</p>
